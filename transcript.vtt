0:0:11.520 --> 0:0:17.210
<v 88b66bf7-d0d1-4ed1-bb80-ce79d271ac2a@72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47>Yeah, the transcriber has started, Yeah, but only you can see it. I think because I don't have the feature.</v>

0:0:18.500 --> 0:0:21.110
<v 68f0e9b4-d6de-4cad-9c2a-9b587e97837f@72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47>Oh interesting. OK, well I mean OK.</v>

0:0:22.100 --> 0:0:22.650

0:0:25.810 --> 0:0:31.550
<v 68f0e9b4-d6de-4cad-9c2a-9b587e97837f@72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47>Ah, I see. I see I wanted to like Maka meeting right now.</v>

0:0:42.80 --> 0:0:47.770
<v 68f0e9b4-d6de-4cad-9c2a-9b587e97837f@72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47>I don't know yet. I don't know yet. I'm just going to support for a little bit longer until we have to drop.</v>

0:0:47.290 --> 0:0:52.120
<v 88b66bf7-d0d1-4ed1-bb80-ce79d271ac2a@72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47>I feel like I feel like there's no minimum time though, like it'll just work right?</v>

0:0:52.510 --> 0:0:53.60
<v 68f0e9b4-d6de-4cad-9c2a-9b587e97837f@72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47>Really.</v>

0:1:3.110 --> 0:1:4.350
<v 68f0e9b4-d6de-4cad-9c2a-9b587e97837f@72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47>I think it will record.</v>

0:1:3.700 --> 0:1:9.20
<v 88b66bf7-d0d1-4ed1-bb80-ce79d271ac2a@72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47>I mean, I think there's like no short like there's no minimum time for the transcribing to work.</v>

0:1:9.330 --> 0:1:25.610
<v 68f0e9b4-d6de-4cad-9c2a-9b587e97837f@72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47>Oh yeah, yeah yeah no, I just want to like like have more data for it to like. Pick up on 'cause like um's. It said that like the biggest problem with this like transcribing feature for users is that it won't pick up on accents which won't happen here. But like if multiple people are talking, it's hard to pick up on stuff.</v>

0:1:23.590 --> 0:1:24.0
<v 88b66bf7-d0d1-4ed1-bb80-ce79d271ac2a@72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47>Really.</v>

0:1:30.880 --> 0:1:35.810
<v 68f0e9b4-d6de-4cad-9c2a-9b587e97837f@72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47>OK, cool, um, OK let's just like try to mimic some like action items.</v>

0:1:36.690 --> 0:1:45.570
<v 88b66bf7-d0d1-4ed1-bb80-ce79d271ac2a@72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47>OK, I can start well, I guess I can actually show like evolution standardization just like now, but like I can show what I was thinking for the presentation at least.</v>

0:1:36.820 --> 0:1:38.940
<v 68f0e9b4-d6de-4cad-9c2a-9b587e97837f@72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47>OK ah OK.</v>

Usually people like don't like we can use service ticks where like people don't actually talk about the guts and like the important parts of the meeting. So like.</v>

0:2:1.410 --> 0:2:7.70
<v 88b66bf7-d0d1-4ed1-bb80-ce79d271ac2a@72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47>Like at least like one minute after that like yeah later second like only analyze that part or something I don't know.</v>

0:4:33.970 --> 0:4:34.500
<v b233e3b4-795e-46a8-8693-02be3ad11a41@72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47>Are you testing?</v>

0:4:43.360 --> 0:4:54.0
<v 68f0e9b4-d6de-4cad-9c2a-9b587e97837f@72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47>Yeah, we're testing that. It's like weird 'cause like it's in beta form and so only some people see us. Some people don't. I guess I'm lucky 'cause I'm. I see I see it on my end, but I don't think Jeffrey does.</v>

0:4:43.800 --> 0:4:44.390
<v 88b66bf7-d0d1-4ed1-bb80-ce79d271ac2a@72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47>Yeah.</v>

0:4:58.840 --> 0:4:59.660
<v 68f0e9b4-d6de-4cad-9c2a-9b587e97837f@72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47>Yeah, yeah.</v>

0:5:1.590 --> 0:5:1.970
<v 68f0e9b4-d6de-4cad-9c2a-9b587e97837f@72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47>Yeah.</v>

0:5:3.80 --> 0:5:5.370
<v 88b66bf7-d0d1-4ed1-bb80-ce79d271ac2a@72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47>I feel like waiting fun to stop transcribing.</v>

0:5:6.580 --> 0:5:9.530
<v 68f0e9b4-d6de-4cad-9c2a-9b587e97837f@72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47>Ah yeah, I think so.</v>

'cause like the meetings that I've tried were the ones that I like created. And so I was able to.</v>

0:5:16.730 --> 0:5:17.690
<v 88b66bf7-d0d1-4ed1-bb80-ce79d271ac2a@72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47>Yeah, maybe.</v>

0:5:20.360 --> 0:5:25.620
<v 88b66bf7-d0d1-4ed1-bb80-ce79d271ac2a@72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47>Yeah, the meeting I saw him last last week was like someone else made the meeting, not me, so might be that.</v>

0:5:25.880 --> 0:5:31.10
<v 68f0e9b4-d6de-4cad-9c2a-9b587e97837f@72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47>OK yeah, maybe we should actually try that and then see if like that makes a difference.</v>

0:5:33.350 --> 0:5:39.10
<v 68f0e9b4-d6de-4cad-9c2a-9b587e97837f@72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47>I mean not not for this experiment, but like in case if you guys actually want to see it, maybe that's something I should try doing.</v>

0:5:39.330 --> 0:5:44.150
<v 88b66bf7-d0d1-4ed1-bb80-ce79d271ac2a@72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47>So I just tried clicking stop transcribed and then seeing what comes out of it, you know?</v>

0:5:43.660 --> 0:5:47.930
<v 68f0e9b4-d6de-4cad-9c2a-9b587e97837f@72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47>Yeah, let me see if I can.</v>

0:6:29.750 --> 0:6:30.860
<v 88b66bf7-d0d1-4ed1-bb80-ce79d271ac2a@72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47>Oh sure, there's This guy that.</v>

0:6:36.160 --> 0:6:49.620
<v 88b66bf7-d0d1-4ed1-bb80-ce79d271ac2a@72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47>Yeah, oh wait, there's This guy but just message me he's like a UX researcher from my org. Captive right it just message me on teams saying he saw our hackathon idea and he wants to like help us and like sit in our meetings and stuff.</v>

0:6:49.720 --> 0:6:52.120
<v 68f0e9b4-d6de-4cad-9c2a-9b587e97837f@72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47>Wait, did you say he's a designer? What did you say?</v>

0:6:51.480 --> 0:6:52.790
<v 88b66bf7-d0d1-4ed1-bb80-ce79d271ac2a@72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47>He's a UX researcher.</v>

0:6:52.970 --> 0:6:55.510
<v 68f0e9b4-d6de-4cad-9c2a-9b587e97837f@72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47>UX researcher OK yeah I posted.</v>

0:6:56.70 --> 0:7:10.750
<v 68f0e9b4-d6de-4cad-9c2a-9b587e97837f@72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47>I I posted um like a like a thing on the design channel and like I had like one guy respond except he was like a I don't know what GPN means in this context but like um.</v>

0:7:10.170 --> 0:7:10.720
<v 88b66bf7-d0d1-4ed1-bb80-ce79d271ac2a@72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47>GPM.</v>

0:7:12.280 --> 0:7:12.670
<v 88b66bf7-d0d1-4ed1-bb80-ce79d271ac2a@72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47>Group.</v>

0:7:18.100 --> 0:7:18.450
<v 88b66bf7-d0d1-4ed1-bb80-ce79d271ac2a@72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47>No.</v>

0:7:18.350 --> 0:7:27.500
<v 68f0e9b4-d6de-4cad-9c2a-9b587e97837f@72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47>It's like, Oh, I could be interested in my team and I could be interested in helping. Like give you some like feedback or something and this area is like so I haven't really spongy that yet.</v>

0:7:26.960 --> 0:7:31.720
<v 88b66bf7-d0d1-4ed1-bb80-ce79d271ac2a@72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47>I think it is actually like pretty interesting realistically, so I think people just like interested in that.</v>

0:7:32.460 --> 0:7:39.630
<v b233e3b4-795e-46a8-8693-02be3ad11a41@72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47>OK, well can you please clarify like so? What's the difference between like what we're suggesting the feature that's already available in teams?</v>

0:7:40.780 --> 0:7:53.700
<v 88b66bf7-d0d1-4ed1-bb80-ce79d271ac2a@72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47>Oh so our suggestion is like it's actually a summary, like 'cause on the meeting in teams is just like word for word transcribing, just text to speech. It all goes. It's pretty basic but our features like it parses to speech through like.</v>

0:7:54.330 --> 0:8:0.120
<v 88b66bf7-d0d1-4ed1-bb80-ce79d271ac2a@72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47>A neural network model to only figure out, like the key important parts of that speech you know.</v>

0:8:0.100 --> 0:8:0.770
<v b233e3b4-795e-46a8-8693-02be3ad11a41@72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47>OK.</v>

0:8:1.150 --> 0:8:2.340
<v 88b66bf7-d0d1-4ed1-bb80-ce79d271ac2a@72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47>Yeah, so that's the difference.</v>

0:8:1.450 --> 0:8:1.900
<v b233e3b4-795e-46a8-8693-02be3ad11a41@72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47>OK.</v>

0:8:5.500 --> 0:8:10.880
<v 68f0e9b4-d6de-4cad-9c2a-9b587e97837f@72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47>I'm reading the transcript. I'm starting to realize how often I used the word like it's pretty sad.</v>

0:8:12.390 --> 0:8:13.680
<v 88b66bf7-d0d1-4ed1-bb80-ce79d271ac2a@72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47>Transfer pretty accurate, right?</v>

0:8:14.400 --> 0:8:19.270
<v 68f0e9b4-d6de-4cad-9c2a-9b587e97837f@72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47>It's like decently accurate. There's like a few things that's like kind of off, but like for the most part, it's been pretty good.</v>

0:8:25.400 --> 0:8:35.610
<v 88b66bf7-d0d1-4ed1-bb80-ce79d271ac2a@72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47>And I feel like when it's when it doesn't know where you're saying in terms of like the word, I'll just like skip it if you're saying like something random, like not a real word, or like there's some noise in the background, there's not a real word then like.</v>

0:8:36.650 --> 0:8:37.180
<v 88b66bf7-d0d1-4ed1-bb80-ce79d271ac2a@72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47>Yeah.</v>

0:8:38.430 --> 0:8:39.940
<v 68f0e9b4-d6de-4cad-9c2a-9b587e97837f@72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47>Interesting, yeah.</v>

0:8:39.290 --> 0:8:42.220
<v 88b66bf7-d0d1-4ed1-bb80-ce79d271ac2a@72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47>So I think it's already smart enough to do that at least.</v>

0:8:43.50 --> 0:8:43.530
<v 68f0e9b4-d6de-4cad-9c2a-9b587e97837f@72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47>Yeah.</v>

0:8:44.690 --> 0:8:46.140
<v 68f0e9b4-d6de-4cad-9c2a-9b587e97837f@72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47>OK, I'm gonna stop.</v>
